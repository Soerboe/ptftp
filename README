# Pretty Trivial File Transfer Protocol #
#########################################

A very simple implementation of the TFTP
built on top of the DCCP transfer protocol.
It has many flaws and should _not_ be used
for anything other than testing.

Currently only reading files from the server
is implemented.


Changes from standard TFTP
    - uses 4 bytes for # blocks
